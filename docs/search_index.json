For more information, the PRISM package can be found on GitHub at PRISM on GitHub. 5.1 PRISM API in Excel One of the primary goals of PRISM is making prediction models accessible to a wide range of audiences, including those with less programming experience. The Excel API is targetted towards users who are less familiar with programming, or users who are familiar with programming and would like an easy way to extract the data quickly. To use the model, you will need to have Excel installed on your computer. Currently, the Excel API only works in Windows (PC), although we are working on developing a version for Mac (OS X) as well. Downloading the Spreadsheet To get started, you will need to go to: PRISM Model Repository. In the row that has the Framingham model, go to the column labelled Excel Interface and click on the link Framingham Excel (PC). This will download the Excel Interface for the Framingham model. "],
["section-appendix1.html", "6 Appendix 1: Installing R 6.1 Step 1: Mirrors 6.2 Mac OS X 6.3 Windows 6.4 Ubuntu", " 6 Appendix 1: Installing R This is a guide to installing R, geared mainly at beginner audiences. All the information below can be found at https://www.r-project.org/; I’ve just simplified it a bit. 6.1 Step 1: Mirrors When you go the the R home page, you will see a link to download R, which will take you to a list of mirrors. They are organized by country, so click on one that is close to your location. Since our group is based out of Vancouver, I will select one of the mirrors in Canada: SFU Mirror. Once you have clicked on the closest mirror, you will be asked to choose what type of computer you have. 6.2 Mac OS X If you are using a Mac (Apple) computer, click on the link for Mac OS X. You will be redirected to a page that says “R for Mac OS X.” To install R, you want to click on one of the files ending in “.pkg”. If your operating system is fairly up-to-date, scroll to “Latest Release” and click on the file that looks like “R-3.X.Y.pkg,” with X and Y being numbers for the latest release. R should begin downloading, and your Mac package manager will pop up with the rest of the instructions. If your operating system is older, you might want to scroll down to “Legacy Releases,” and download one of those “.pkg” files instead. It should tell you on the page what version your computer should use. 6.3 Windows If you are using Windows, click on the link for Windows. You will be redirected to a page that says “R for Windows.” To install R, click on the link “base,” and on the next page, “Download R 3.X.Y for Windows,” where X and Y are the version numbers for the latest release. R should begin downloading. 6.4 Ubuntu First, check which Ubuntu version you are using in Terminal: lsb_release -a {YOUR_UBUNTU_VERSION} is the Codename given. For example, on my computer it would be bionic. Open the /etc/apt/sources.list file: sudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list For R 3.6 paste the following in the file: deb https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/linux/ubuntu {YOUR_UBUNTU_VERSION}-cran35/ On my computer, this would be: deb https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/linux/ubuntu bionic-cran35/ Install R: sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys E298A3A825C0D65DFD57CBB651716619E084DAB9 sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install r-base "]
